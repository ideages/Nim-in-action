Welcome
=======


Thank you for purchasing the MEAP of *Nim in Action*. This is the first ever book about Nim and I am very excited to share the knowledge contained in it with you.


This book assumes that you are fluent in at least one other programming language. When I began writing it, I made a conscious decision to focus the intended audience on software developers, computer science students, hobbyist programmers, and the like. As an example, this book will often show you features of the Nim programming language and then compare those features to that of other programming languages. To illustrate the difference better, fundamentals of programming in general will not be covered, whereas fundamentals of programming in Nim specifically will.


My journey with Nim began in 2010, when I stumbled upon it as I was searching for a compiled replacement for Python. Since then I have been a core part of Nim’s development, over the years I have written many of the modules in Nim’s standard library as well as tools such as the Nimble package manager, which is now a major part of Nim’s ecosystem. This has given me a wealth of experiences and knowledge about Nim which I hope to share with you in this book.


*Nim in Action* is divided into three parts. Part 1 will teach you the basics of Nim, it consists of two chapters, both of which I encourage you to read even if you are already familiar with Nim. Part 2 of the book is more practical and consists of 5 chapters which will lead you through the development of some impressive and hopefully fun to write software including a chat application. Part 3 consists of 3 chapters covering advanced topics like metaprogramming.


The MEAP starts with the first three chapters of the book. Chapter 1 explains what Nim is; its uses, strengths and weaknesses. Chapter 2 first gives instructions on how to set up Nim and related tools; it then goes on to describe many aspects of Nim’s syntax, some of the most useful built-in types, the semantics of control flow statements, and much more.


Chapter 3 puts many of the concepts which you will have learned in Chapter 2 into practice, by guiding you through the development of a simple chat application. As you develop the chat application, you will learn how to retrieve input from the user, how to parse and generate JSON, and how to transfer data over the network.


It is my hope that you will enjoy learning Nim with the aid of this book. I encourage you to visit the Author Online forum, where you will have the opportunity to leave any comments, suggestions, and questions you have about *Nim in Action*. I will truly appreciate you taking the time to do so, as any comments are extremely valuable in the development process.


Thanks again and I hope you enjoy *Nim in Action*.
